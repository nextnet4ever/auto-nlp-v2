Vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems show important functional as well as anatomical similarities in the way in which olfactory signals are detected and processed in their brains , particularly at the level of their first olfactory centres , the olfactory bulb in the case of vertebrates and the antennal lobe ( AL ) in the case of insects [ 5,6,7 ] .

If an odour is presented immediately before sucrose solution ( forward pairing ) , an association is formed and the odour will subsequently trigger the PER in a subsequent unrewarded test .

Using the PER paradigm , Vareschi [ 19 ] showed that bees generalise most often between odours with similar carbon-chain lengths and between odours belonging to the same functional group .

0.92: (bees; generalise most often; between odours with similar carbon-chain lengths and between odours belonging)

However , Vareschi conditioned odours in a differential way , with two rewarded and many unrewarded odours , so that several generalisation gradients ( excitatory and inhibitory ) may have interacted in an unknown way to determine the generalisation responses exhibited by the bees [ 19 ] .

Using a similar approach and a restricted ( 6 × 6 ) set of odour combinations , Smith and Menzel [ 20 ] confirmed that bees generalise among odours with the same functional group , but their analysis did not detail the results obtained with individual odour combinations , thus rendering impossible the analysis of generalisation between odours with similar carbon-chain lengths .

Although other studies have addressed the issue of perceptual correlates of neural representations [ 32,33 ] , we show for the first time that neural olfactory activity corresponds to olfactory perception defined on the basis of specific dimensions in a putative olfactory space , a finding that is of central importance in the study of the neurobiology of perception .

A Putative Olfactory Space for the Honeybee We found that the two controlled physical characteristics of odour molecules used in this study , functional group and chain length , correspond to internal dimensions in the bees ' olfactory perceptual space such as the three most important factors extracted in our PCA analysis , one mainly represented chain length and the other two were mostly influenced by functional group .

Interestingly , C6 and C7 molecules and C8 and C9 molecules were mainly grouped together , so that , for instance , all short-chain primary and secondary alcohols were grouped on one side , and all long-chain alcohols on the other side .

This discrepancy suggests that , although chain length appears mostly as a perceptual continuum in the PCA analysis , there may be a perceptual `` jump '' between short-chain and long-chain molecules .

Neural Bases of Odour Perception Both in vertebrates and in invertebrates , studies quantifying the neural responses to structurally similar odours in the first relay of the olfactory pathway have been performed ( olfactory bulb : e.g. , [ 46,47,48,49 ] ; AL : [ 23,50 ] ) .

Several correspondences , but also discrepancies , can be found between our behavioural results and the physiological results obtained at the level of the bee AL [ 23 ] .

First , within the regions of the AL accessible to optical imaging ( about 25 % of the glomeruli ) , patterns of glomerular activity for different odours are highly dependent on chain length , but much less so on chemical group .
0.39: (optical imaging about 25 % of the glomeruli ) patterns of glomerular activity for different odours; are much less; highly dependent on chain length within)

Thus , most active glomeruli respond to several functional groups as long as the chain length corresponds , but respond differentially to different chain lengths .

1.00: (the chain length; corresponds; )
0.70: (most active glomeruli the chain length; respond differentially; to different chain lengths)

Glomeruli T1–28 and T1–52 are specialised in short-chain molecules ( respectively C5–C7 and C6–C7 ) , whilst glomeruli T1–33 and T1–17 are specialised in long-chain molecules ( respectively C7–C9 and C8–C9 ) .
0.68: (glomeruli T1–33 and T1–17; are respectively; in long-chain molecules)

These glomeruli also respond to most functional groups but in a graded way .
1.00: (These glomeruli; respond; to most functional groups)

For instance , glomerulus T1–17 responds more to alcohols in the intermediate range than to aldehydes or ketones , whereas T1–52 generally responds more to ketones in the short range , more to aldehydes in the long range , and overall little to alcohols .
0.96: (glomerulus T1–17; responds; more to alcohols in the intermediate range than to aldehydes or ketones)
0.75: (T1–52; generally responds; more to ketones in the short range , more to aldehydes in the long range , and overall little to alcohols)

No individual glomerulus was found that responds specifically to a chemical group .

However , it should be kept in mind that some regions of the ALs are not yet accessible to calcium imaging techniques ( about 75 % of the lobe ; see below ) .

Thus , a possible explanation is that glomeruli responding to specific chemical groups ( or with responses more dependent on chemical groups than on chain length ) were not imaged .

Second , primary and secondary alcohols induce extremely similar activation patterns in the AL , but subtle differences could be found , so that for a given chain length , the representation of a secondary alcohol was between that of the primary alcohol of the same chain length and that with one less carbon atom ( see Figure 6B in Sachse et al .

We found a similar arrangement of alcohol representations , with primary and secondary alcohols alternating on a common axis ( see Figure 6A ) .

The Correspondence between Perceptual and Physiological Odour Similarity We aimed at comparing behavioural and physiological data in a more precise way , using correlation analyses between our behavioural similarity matrix , in which distances between two odour points represent psychological distances between stimuli , and a physiological similarity matrix obtained from optophysiological recordings of glomerular activation patterns [ 23 ] .

With respect to the first point , it could be argued that the AL circuitry transforms the primary-afferent representations of odours [ 25 ] such that recordings where primary-afferent receptor activity is predominant are not very useful for evaluating optophysiological similarity .
0.98: (primary-afferent receptor activity; is; predominant recordings)
1.00: (recordings where primary-afferent receptor activity is predominant; are not; very useful for evaluating optophysiological similarity)

However the very fact that we found a significant correlation between our behavioural data and the imaging data by Sachse et al .

[ 23 ] , strongly suggests that the perceptual quality of odorants mostly appears at the peripheral level .
0.98: (23; strongly suggests; that the perceptual quality of odorants mostly appears at the peripheral level)
1.00: (the perceptual quality of odorants; mostly appears; at the peripheral level)

Clearly , this correlation was not perfect , and odour quality is most probably refined by further processing within the AL , and/or at higher stages of the olfactory pathway , such as in the mushroom bodies or the lateral protocerebrum .

However , in the future , a careful comparison of our behavioural data with both bath-applied imaging data emphasising receptor neuron input ( as done here ) and selective imaging of PNs would be extremely helpful in understanding to what extent AL processing shapes odour perceptual quality .

With respect to the second point , calcium imaging recordings of AL activity are certainly limited to the dorsal part of the AL , which is the region accessible when the head capsule is opened in order to expose the brain for recordings .

This is an inherent limitation of the method that the use of two-photon microscopy during calcium imaging measurements will soon allow us to overcome , as shown already by recordings obtained in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster [ 55 ] .

Finally , with respect to the third point , it is known that learning alters odour representations in the AL , when bees are trained in a differential conditioning procedure , with one odour rewarded and another odour unrewarded [ 53 ] .

0.85: (the conditioning procedure used in our work; was; absolute ( only one)

In the bee , changes in the olfactory code due to absolute conditioning seem to be difficult to detect ( C. G. Galizia , personal communication ) , such that this point may not be so critical for our correlation analysis .

In any case , if there are changes in odour representations due to conditioning , recording glomerular activity patterns after conditioning would only improve our correlation analyses .

Generalisation Asymmetries between Odours We have found a number of asymmetries in olfactory cross-generalisation , with bees responding more to odour B after learning odour A than in the reverse situation .

In our work , generalisation asymmetries could not be directly explained by differences in odour concentration ( through differences in vapour pressure ) , because , for instance , the two odours with the highest vapour pressure in our sample ( 2-hexanone and hexanal ) produced totally opposite results : 2-hexanone induced important generalisation , while hexanal strongly reduced generalisation .

Also , although we used 16 different odours with a range of different vapour pressures , we found that acquisition was very similar for most odours , except for the short-chain ketones , which were less easily learned .

Wright and Smith [ 57 ] studied the effect of odour concentration in generalisation in honeybees .

Further experiments using odorants at different concentrations should be carried out to determine the effect of odour concentration on generalisation asymmetries .

0.20: (Further experiments using odorants at different concentrations; to determine; the effect of odour concentration on generalisation asymmetries)

Generalisation asymmetries could be due to innate or experience-dependent differences in the salience of odours for honeybees , such that more salient odours would induce higher generalisation than less salient odours .
1.00: (Generalisation asymmetries; could be; due to innate or experience-dependent differences in the salience of odours for honeybees)
1.00: (more salient odours; would induce; higher generalisation than less salient odours)

This interpretation implies that most aldehydes ( hexanal , heptanal , and octanal ) are highly salient odours for honeybees , because aldehydes showed a clear `` functional group '' effect , which could reveal a certain bias of the olfactory system towards these odours .
0.98: (aldehydes; showed; a clear `` functional group '' effect , which could reveal a certain bias of the olfactory system towards these odours)

0.90: (most aldehydes ( hexanal , heptanal , and octanal; are; highly salient odours for honeybees)

Ketones , on the other hand , showed a heterogeneous effect , as 2-hexanone seemed to have a low salience ( it was not well learnt ) and induced a high generalisation to other odours , while 2-nonanone consistently reduced generalisation to other odours .
1.00: (Ketones; showed; a heterogeneous effect)

0.54: (it 2-nonanone; well induced consistently reduced; a high generalisation to other odours generalisation to other odours)

In the group of alcohols , only 2-hexanol induced generalisation to other odours .
0.91: (only 2-hexanol; induced; generalisation to other odours In the group of alcohols)

Therefore , only aldehydes showed a clear group effect on generalisation asymmetry .
1.00: (only aldehydes; showed; a clear group effect on generalisation asymmetry)

This effect could be due to innate odour preferences [ 58,59 ] or to previous odour exposure within the hive [ 60,61 ] .
1.00: (This effect; could be; due to innate odour preferences [ 58,59 ] or to previous odour exposure within the hive)

Innate odour preferences could be related to natural , floral odours that were more consistently associated with food resources [ 20,62 ] .
1.00: (Innate odour preferences; could be related; to natural , floral odours)
1.00: (natural , floral odours; were more consistently associated; with food resources)

It is thus important to investigate whether or not such ecological trends exist in the natural flora associated with the honeybee and whether or not other bee species also present such clear biases , in particular towards aldehydes .

Conversely , asymmetries could be the result of the conditioning procedure .

Indeed , experience-induced modifications of odour representations have been found at the level of the honeybee AL .

Thus , odour-evoked calcium signals in the AL can be modified by elemental [ 53 ] and nonelemental olfactory learning paradigms [ 35 ] such that the representations of odours that have to be discriminated become more distinct and uncorrelated as a result of learning .

These elements suggest that modifications of odour representation after learning two different odours could indeed be asymmetrical : if , for instance , the neuronal representation of A after conditioning becomes A′ , which is slightly farther away from B than A in the bee 's olfactory space , and if the perceptual representation of B becomes B′ after conditioning , which is closer to A than B , then bees would show less generalisation in behavioural tests from A to B than from B to A .

Euclidian ( i.e. , direct ) distances in the 16-dimensional space are defined as with i and j indicating odours , p the number of dimensions—that is , conditioning groups—and Xik the response of bees to odour i after conditioning to odour k. These distances were used in correlation analyses with optical imaging data ( see below ) .

Correlation analysis between perceptual and optophysiological similarity measures We studied whether or not physiological similarity between odours as determined by optical imaging studies of AL activity [ 22,23,35 ] actually reflects perceptual odour similarity for the bees .

To this end , we performed correlation analyses between published optical imaging data that were obtained using the same set of odours as in our work [ 23 ] and our behavioural data .

First , to perform such a correlation on the whole dataset ( including all 16 odours ) , we transcribed the activation maps presented by Sachse et al .

[ 23 ] ( see Figure 7 ) into activation levels for each glomerulus from zero to three , according to the following signal scale : dark blue ( 0 % –20 % ) and light blue ( > 20 % –40 % activity ) , zero ; green ( > 40 % –60 % activity ) , one ; yellow ( > 60 % –80 % activity ) , two ; and red ( > 80 % activity ) , three .
0.97: (23 ]; see; Figure 7)

As the activity under 40 % was less accurately separated from noise , activation levels between 0 % and 40 % were ranked as 0 .

0.92: (activation levels between 0 % and 40 %; were ranked; as 0 As)

Scaling the physiological data in this way instead of using the original imaging activation data , gave a good overview of physiological similarity between odours for imaging data ( see Results ) .

To provide a more precise correlation analysis between behavioural and imaging data , albeit on a more limited odour dataset ( eight odours ) , we used exact correlation data ( [ 23 ] , Table 1 ) .
