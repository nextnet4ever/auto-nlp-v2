in vitro ELISA. IC 50 values were obtained by fitting the data to a 4-parameter logistic equation in Origin.S6. Effect of combination treatment of TAT-braftide and vemurafenib against BRAFWT/G469A. HEK293 
cells transiently transfected with BRAFWT/G469A were pre-treated with braftide (75 µM) for 2 hr and then 
vemurafenib was added at the indicated concentrations for 1 hr. Cell lysates were subject to immunoblotting 
for the indicated proteins. SUPPLEMENTAL METHODS
Transient Transfection into Mammalian Cells 
HEK293 cells were plated at one million cells per 2 mL DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 
1% L-glutamine. These cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 for 24 hours or until the cells 
reach a confluency of 40-60%. DNA (1-3 μg) was mixed with PEI-MAX in a 1:3 ratio in opti-
MEM at RT for ~25 minutes and added onto the cells with fresh media.2 After 48 hrs, the cells 
were washed with cold PBS, harvested, lysed with 4% SDS and homogenized. For peptide assays, 
48 hrs post-tranfection, cells were treated with TAT-Braftide/TAT control in reduced serum media 
at the indicated concentrations for 4 hrs. The cells were then washed twice with PBS, lysed as 
above and quantified with the BCA protein assay. Equal amounts of cell lysates were loaded for 
immunoblotting and then probed for relevant proteins. For cell-based synergy assays, 48 hrs post-
transfection, the cells were treated with TAT-braftide at the indicated concentration for 2 hrs. 
Thereafter, dabrafenib or vemurafenib were added to the cells at the indicated concentrations for 
1 hr. Cells were washed twice with PBS and processed as above. Protein concentrations were 
determined with BCA assays for immunoblotting. 
Full-Length BRAF and MEK Purification 
FL-BRAFWT/G469A were expressed in HEK293F cells.3, 4 The cell culture pellet was lysed in salt 
buffer supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors, sonicated and centrifuged to obtain 
the supernatant. The supernatant was filtered and applied to pre-equilibrated cobalt resin for 2-3 
hrs at 4°C. Resin was washed extensively with salt buffer and the the protein was eluted off the 
resin with an imidazole gradient. Elutions were analyzed through SDS-PAGE gels, pooled and 
further purified through size-exclusion chromatography. Similarly, kinase-dead 6X-His/MEK-
(K97M)/GST protein was purified from E.coli (BL21 codon plus).5 Bacterial cultures were grown 
and induced with 0.5 mM IPTG at 16-18°C overnight.  The cell pellet was lysed in lysis buffer as 
indicated above, sonicated and centrifuged to obtain the supernatant and incubated with 
equilibrated cobalt resin 2-3 hours. The protein bound resin was washed with salt buffer as 
described above. MEK1 was eluted with imidazole buffer and further purified through size-
exclusion chromatography. Proteins were concentrated and stored at -80°C.
B-Raf kinase domain purification
B-Raf kinase domain was expressed in E. coli (2L culture) and the pellet was resuspended in low 
salt buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, containing 2 protease inhibitor 
cocktail tablets and 100 mg lysozyme). The pellet was then incubated at room temperature for 1 
hr after which it was sonicated at 30% amplitude for 60 seconds. The lysed mixture was 
centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 45 min. During this time, cobalt-affinity resin was equilibrated in 
low salt buffer and the cell lysate was then incubated on the resin for 2 hrs at 4 C. After incubation, 
the resin was washed with low salt (150 mM NaCl) and high salt (400 mM) buffers. At the last 
wash, the buffer was switched to pH 7.4. The bound protein was eluted with a 200/400 mM 
solution of imidazole. The protein was further purified on a size-exclusion column and then flash-
frozen for storage.1 
ELISA assays 
ELISA assays were adapted from Qin et al. 2012.6 Glutathione-coated plates were conditioned in 
HTBS buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20). The plates were 
incubated with GST-tagged, kinase-dead, MEK (0.0025 mg mL-1) for >2 hr with shaking. Appropriate concentrations of the peptide were made and pre-incubated with BRAFWT/G469A (5 nM 
final) full-length protein for 90 min. After 2 hr, the MEK solution was washed away and replaced 
with an ATP kinase buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl 2, 50 mM  -
glycerol phosphate, 40 µM ATP). The BRAF/peptide mixture was then added to the ATP-cocktail 
(1:1) and the kinase reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min at 30°C. Thereafter, the reaction 
mixture was washed away and sequentially incubated with the primary antibody (pMEK 
S217/221) for 1 hr, followed by secondary antibody (anti-rabbit, LI-COR) for 1 hr. After final 
washing steps, the chemiluminescent agent (Pierce) was added to the wells and the luminescence 
was measured on a Biotek plate reader.
Determination of binding affinity (K D) through Fluorescence Intensity 
Braftide was synthesized with Cy3 fluorescent label. Cy3 dye has excitation/emission wavelengths 
of 535/570 nm respectively and changes in braftide-cy3 fluorescence upon BRAF binding can be 
monitored through cy3 emission.7, 8 For fluorescence intensity experiments, BRAFWT kinase 
domain protein was used because of higher protein yields from purification compared to full-length 
BRAF. Briefly, braftide-cy3 concentration was kept constant at 0.5 M and BRAF-KD protein 
was titrated into the peptide (serial dilutions starting from 40 M). Titrations were done in 20 mM 
HEPES, 150 mM NaCl and 5% glycerol buffer.  Fluorescence intensity was measured on a Tecan 
plate reader at excitation/emission wavelengths of 535/574 for Cy3 (excitation/emission 
bandwidth slits were set at 5 nm for both). Fluorescence measurements were corrected by 
subtraction of background buffer scans. Fluorescence scans of protein by itself, without ligand, 
were performed to ensure no interference from protein at Cy3 wavelengths.  Binding affinity (K D) 
was determined by fitting the data to a one-site binding model in Origin.

Data Analysis and Statistics 
For the dose-response curves, the inhibition data was fit to the 4-parameter logistic equation (dose-
response fitting equation) in Origin.

Error bars are indicative of the SEM of each point, and 95% confidence intervals of the IC 50 values 
are listed in the figure legend, as calculated using Origin.
Western Blot band densities were quantified with ImageJ software (NIH) and normalized to the 
loading control.
